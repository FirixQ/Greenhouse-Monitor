# Greenhouse Monitor
Arduino code for a greenhouse monitoring station (written for mega)

## What is this?
These are Arduino sketches I have written for the Arduino Mega 2560 / ESP8266 that take readings from a lux meter, thermometer and humidity meter. Depending on the version it is either then outputted to a display or saved on a microSD card.
